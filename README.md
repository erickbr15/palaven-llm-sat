# PALAVEN - Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction
This project leverages .NET 6 (Long Term Support) to create a backend-focused solution incorporating OpenAI's Chat and Embeddings services, Pinecone's HTTP API, and Azure AI for PDF text extraction. This phase does not include web APIs or Azure Functions but features three console applications for data ingestion, vector index creation, and testing interactions with OpenAI's Chat API.

## 2. Requirements and Setup
### System and Software Requirements
- .NET 6 (LTS) environment.
- Access to OpenAI APIs.
- Pinecone HTTP API setup.
- Azure AI services for text extraction.

### Configuration
- Setup instructions for .NET 6 environment.
- Configuration steps for integrating OpenAI, Pinecone, and Azure AI services.

## 3. System Architecture
The system architecture comprises three main components:
1. **Data Ingestion Console App**: Handles the ingestion of data sources.
2. **Vector Index Creation Console App**: Responsible for creating the vector index using Pinecone.
3. **OpenAI Chat API Interaction Console App**: Facilitates testing and interaction with OpenAI's Chat API.

## 4. OpenAI API Integration
### Chat and Embeddings Services
- Examples of API calls to OpenAI for chat and embeddings functionalities.
- Expected responses and error handling.

## 5. Interacting with Pinecone
### Using Pinecone's HTTP API
- Detailed steps for populating the index and querying vectors.
- Code snippets demonstrating API interactions.

## 6. RAG Implementation
### Role of RAG in the LLM
- Explanation of how RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is implemented.
- Specific examples showing the impact of RAG on the project.
